/* TODOs
 * 1- Why not just a const getter for the particle pool instead of public?
 * 2- Since we have the lifetime > 0.0 to see if particles are active,
 * an active particle counter and the pool property of having active particles
 * at the front, couldn't we just get rid of the activeflags container??
 * Maybe performance wise it is just safer to have one...TBD
 * 3- Try AoS vs SoA (in other words move the particle parameters here
 * and create an array for each
 * 4- See unique_ptr vs vector for pool
